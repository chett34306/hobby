About \n\n

What started in 2006 as a blog about Seattle real estate with an emphasis on lofts, condos, new construction and
mid-century moderns has evolved into a boutique real estate company. We still blog, but more importantly
we can now help you buy and sell amazing homes in the Seattle area. From Beacon Hill to Ballard (and beyond),
from $200,000 to $2+ million, weâ€™d love to help you.
